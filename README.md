# Changelogged

This is a simple module to autogenerate a list of merged PRs in a given commit range. After trying out various existing CLI tools or Web-Apps I didn't find one that worked or matched the formatting style that we use for [Preact](https://github.com/developit/preact/). It's something that I quickly hacked together to make my life easier when creating the release notes.

People kept asking me what tool I use, so I spent 2 evenings adding proper error handling and converting it into a proper module. It's by no means perfect and doesn't support advanced features or anything, but it does the job for me. I mainly published it because it may prove to be useful for other OSS peers. I'm open to accept PRs though, if somebody wants to add that.

_Note: It's limited to 100 possible entries in a range and you need a valid [GitHub API token](https://developer.github.com/v4/guides/forming-calls/#authenticating-with-graphql) to be able to use this module._

## Usage

```bash
npm install -g changelogged
# or via yarn
yarn add -g changelogged
```

Then `cd` in your git repository and run `changelogged <tagOrCommit>..HEAD`. Enter your GitHub Token et voil√†!

Example output:

```bash
GitHub: developit/preact
PRs: 3

- move JSX namespace into preact one (#1448, thanks @just-boris)
- Remove unused component import (#1508, thanks @marvinhagemeister)
- (fix) - debug message should not throw for undefined and null (#1505, thanks @JoviDeCroock)
```

Full cli args:

```bash

                  The default is: '- %m (#%n, thanks @%a)'
